## Paper Overview

The paper focuses on solving the **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)** problem by rearranging and partitioning the original KKT matrix and solving it with recursive schur compliments. Key steps of the solver method include:

- Rearranging the KKT matrix

## Code Dictionary for Variables

Hence there are many different names for Control and State variables  we provide this table to further facilitate understanding of our code in BCHOL (corresponding to the paper vars) and its integration into the [GATO](https://github.com/A2R-Lab/GATO) repository. 

| Variable Name in the Paper    | Access in BCHOL        | Variable Name in GATO       | Description                              |

## Memory Design

Before we dive into our solver method it's important to understand the underlying memory structure. We will quickly inspect the original memory design in the C- implementation, then switch to our CUDA memory design and explain the details about the imports between shared and device memory. 

![Memory Layout](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6771ba9-9d61-405c-aa21-e472f816521d)

### NDData 
[NDdata](https://github.com/bjack205/rsLQR/blob/main/src/nddata.h)  helps us to separate: 

**A)** Initial Dynamic Matrices inside ND Data_Data**

**B)** Factorized matrices that will hold solutions to intermediate levels inside ND Data_Fact 

**C)** soln vector inside ND Data_soln (initially b vector that is solved in place)


### NDFactor 

NDfactor is the underlying structure that holds a chunk of memory for a single time step. It stores it in a way of a matrix size(2n+m) divided into blocks:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} 
\Lambda \\ 
X \\ 
U 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Binary Tree Structure
Last but not least, let's talk about the tree structure. After we refactorzied our [matrix](https://github.com/A2R-Lab/BCHOL/tree/main/doc#:~:text=Solving%20with%20Schur%20from%20the%20lowest%20levels%20%2D%20bottom%20up%20to%20the%20original%20KKT) and solved the independent equations we have two levels of systems for horizon 4. We can see that the matrix structure resembles the binary tree with *-I* matrix being next to the actual time step. The Binary tree structure is the underlying structure of ND Data_Data and ND Data_Fact.

*Examples :*
|Binary Tree for N=4| ND Data | 
|----------|----------|
| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60807e1b-3174-4aff-aa9e-7c45b1bda484) | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba2d6781-2f38-4ec7-adae-b08b691c4b42) | 

| Binary Tree for N=8 | ND Data |
|----------------------|---------|
| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30a611ef-6d6f-4681-9d38-f4083b9fe147) | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93f11632-2e97-44fe-b5f9-fcb5b078161b) |

### CUDA Implementation

For the CUDA Implementation we are abondoning the ND_Data and ND_Factor structures. 

* ND Data_Data which contains original A and B matrices instead is saved into A_B 1D array, where A and B.T are saved in column-major order and sequentually stored (A1, B1.T, A2,B2.T...)
*Q,R matrices are saved in condensed state (only diagonals) in 1D array sequentially (Q1,R1,Q2,R2..)
*q,r vectors are saved in the same manner in q_r array
*d vector is saved as a separate d array.

It is important to emphasize that q,r,d are solved in place and become x,u,lambda - solution vector.

Finally for the ND Data_Fact (the factorized matrices that keep the intermediate solutions of matrices and Cholesky factorizations) the tree structure is very crutial as the logic of the algorithm is based on the levels. Hence we are declaring 3 different arrays

* **F_lambda** - an array of all the lambdas from the ND Factors stores sequentally level by level, for example for n=8 it'll be of size 24(8 timesteps*3 levels)ÃstateÃstate
* **F_state** - an array of all the states from the ND Factors stores sequentyally level by level
* * **F_input** - an array of all the states from the ND Factors stores sequentyally level by level
  
# Specific CUDA Code Overview
[Include diagrams and explain the F-factor; F_lambda and etc../]
The CUDA kernel implementation in `solve_lqr.cu` is designed to leverage the parallel processing power of NVIDIA GPUs. Key features include:

- **Thread-Level Parallelism**:  
  Each thread computes part of the solution for a state/control update.

- **Shared Memory Optimization**:  
  Frequently accessed data (e.g., matrices `A`, `B`, `Q`, `R`) is stored in shared memory to reduce global memory access overhead.

- **Memory Coalescing**:  
  Data access is optimized for efficient coalescing to minimize latency.

- **Use of cuBLAS**:  
  The `cuBLAS` library is employed for matrix operations like multiplication, ensuring high-performance computation.

## Implementation Uniqueness

The implementation distinguishes itself with the following unique features:

1. **Custom CUDA Kernel for Parallel Matrix Updates**:  
   - Unlike typical cuBLAS-only approaches, this implementation includes custom kernels for parts of the computation, enabling fine-grained control over memory and execution flow.

2. **Low Latency for Real-Time Applications**:  
   - Specifically optimized for scenarios where rapid LQR computations are required, such as robotics and control systems.

3. **Scalability**:  
   - The code scales efficiently with problem size and GPU resources, leveraging hierarchical parallelism (blocks and threads).

4. **Error Debugging with Device Flags**:  
   - The `-g -G` flags in the `Makefile` enable device-side debugging for easier identification of runtime issues.
