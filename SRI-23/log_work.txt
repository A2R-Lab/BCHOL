Current status:
new-test and local-new_test both have working versions for 1 block

Goals:
-identify problems for 2 blocks (right now send nan)

Problems:
F_state is not copied but d,q,r are correct
When using 1 block F_state is copied

Reminder:
d = lambda
q =state
r = input

Line 511 is causing troubles for 1 block general solution, but works fine for solve_leaf

for (uint32_t ind = block_id; ind < numleaves; ind += grid_dim)
    {
      for(uint32_t ind = 0; ind < cur_depth; ind+=block_dim) 
      {}
    }
instead of for(uint32_t ind = block_id; ind < num_products; ind += grid_dim)

Can we do threads here or should we leave it as block?

Loop 672-679 chage to have 2 loops per blocks
Everything works till Shur complements

Figure out dependency flow

Update Shur:
1 block, without line 511, without grind sync solves 
1 block, without line 511, with grynd sync (760) still works

8 blocks, with 511, with grynd sync no problem with iterations
